# RN diff PURGE

This repository exposes an untouched React Native Windows app generated with the CLI
`npx react-native init RnDiffApp` then `npx react-native-windows-init`. Each new React Native Windows release will get a new project, removing the old one, and getting a diff between them. This way, the diff is always clean, always in sync with the changes of the init template.

A dedicated branch per release makes changes very easy
to watch.
