# react-native-windows diffs

The purpose of this repository is to help people update their **react-native-windows** applications to new versions.

This repository exposes an untouched **react-native-windows** app generated with the CLI, `npx react-native init RnDiffApp` then `npx react-native-windows-init`. Each new **react-native-windows** release will create a new branch.  Users can get a sense of what changes are required to update **react-native-windows** by going to https://github.com/acoates-ms/rnw-diff/compare/release/cpp/0.63.27...release/cpp/0.64.3, and selecting the versions they are updating from/to.
